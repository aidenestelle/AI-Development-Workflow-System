# AGENTS.md - Specialized Agent System

## Overview
This system provides specialized agents for Claude Code that are context-aware, token-efficient, and optimized for specific development tasks.

---

## Agent Architecture

### Core Principles
1. **Minimal Context Loading** - Load only what's needed for the task
2. **Smart Context Awareness** - Understand what information is critical
3. **Token Budget Management** - Stay within limits while being effective
4. **Specialized Expertise** - Each agent is expert in their domain
5. **Clean Handoffs** - Agents communicate through documented context

---

## Available Agents

### 1. Orchestrator Agent (You)
**Role:** Task coordination and delegation  
**Context Requirements:** Minimal  
**Token Budget:** Conservative (20-30k tokens)

**Responsibilities:**
- Read TASKS.md to identify next task
- Determine which specialist agent is needed
- Spawn specialist with minimal context
- Monitor progress
- Ensure context updates
- Manage chat compaction

**Context Loaded:**
```
✓ docs/TASKS.md (current tasks only)
✓ docs/AI_RULESET.md (workflow rules)
✗ Implementation details
✗ Full codebase
✗ Historical context
```

**Agent Prompt Template:**
```markdown

## Token Budget Management

### Budget Allocation by Agent

| Agent | Budget | Typical Context Size | Priority |
|-------|--------|---------------------|----------|
| Orchestrator | 20-30k | Minimal (task list only) | Critical |
| Planning | 40-60k | Task + relevant code | High |
| Frontend Impl | 80-120k | Components + types | High |
| Backend Impl | 80-120k | APIs + schema | High |
| Full-Stack Impl | 120-150k | Both stacks | Very High |
| Database | 50-80k | Schema + migrations | High |
| Testing | 80-120k | Implementation + tests | High |
| Refactoring | 120-150k | Full file(s) to refactor | Very High |
| Documentation | 30-50k | Summaries only | Medium |

### Context Loading Strategy

**Always Load (Critical):**
- Current task from TASKS.md
- Relevant section of AI_RULESET.md
- Agent-specific guidelines

**Load When Needed:**
- Files being modified
- Related files (imports/exports)
- Type definitions
- Database schema (if relevant)

**Never Load (Unless Explicitly Needed):**
- Historical context
- Completed tasks
- Unrelated codebase
- Full project structure

### Token Saving Techniques

**1. Lazy Loading**
```markdown
Instead of: "Load entire codebase"
Use: "Load only files listed in task"
```

**2. Summarization**
```markdown
Instead of: "Full file content"
Use: "Function signatures + modified sections only"
```

**3. Progressive Detail**
```markdown
Start with: File structure
If needed: Function signatures  
Only if critical: Full implementation
```

**4. Context Pruning**
```markdown
After each agent:
- Remove implementation details
- Keep only outcomes
- Pass minimal context to next agent
```

## Agent Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Simple Bug Fix

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Orchestrator] -->|Task: Fix bug| B[Planning Agent]
    B -->|Plan approved| C[Frontend Impl]
    C -->|Code complete| D[Testing Agent]
    D -->|Tests pass| E[Orchestrator]
    E -->|Update complete| F[Done]
```

**Token Usage:**
- Orchestrator: 25k (task list)
- Planning: 45k (task + error + related code)
- Frontend: 95k (components + types)
- Testing: 85k (test files + criteria)
- **Total: ~250k across 4 agents**

### Example 2: New Feature (Full-Stack)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Orchestrator] -->|Task: New feature| B[Planning Agent]
    B -->|Plan approved| C[Full-Stack Impl]
    C -->|Frontend >450 lines| D[Orchestrator]
    D -->|Create refactor task| E[Refactoring Agent]
    E -->|Refactor complete| F[Testing Agent]
    F -->|Tests pass| G[Documentation Agent]
    G -->|Docs updated| H[Done]
```

**Token Usage:**
- Orchestrator (initial): 25k
- Planning: 55k
- Full-Stack: 140k (both stacks)
- Orchestrator (refactor trigger): 20k
- Refactoring: 130k (full file + splits)
- Testing: 110k (both stacks + tests)
- Documentation: 35k (summaries)
- **Total: ~515k across 7 agent invocations**

### Example 3: Database Migration

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Orchestrator] -->|Task: Schema change| B[Planning Agent]
    B -->|Plan approved| C[Database Agent]
    C -->|Migration complete| D[Backend Impl]
    D -->|API updated| E[Frontend Impl]
    E -->|UI updated| F[Testing Agent]
    F -->|Tests pass| G[Done]
```

**Token Usage:**
- Orchestrator: 25k
- Planning: 50k (schema + requirements)
- Database: 65k (schema + migration)
- Backend: 90k (API files)
- Frontend: 85k (components)
- Testing: 100k (E2E tests)
- **Total: ~415k across 6 agents**

---

## Smart Context Strategies

### 1. Differential Context
**Only load what changed since last known state**

```markdown
Previous state: User.tsx (300 lines)
Changes needed: Add avatar upload
Context loaded: 
- Avatar-related functions only
- Upload utility
- Storage types
NOT loaded:
- Entire User.tsx
- Unrelated profile functions
```

### 2. Dependency Mapping
**Load based on import chains**

```markdown
Modifying: UserProfile.tsx
Imports: 
✓ Avatar.tsx (loads this)
✓ useUser.ts (loads this)
✓ types/user.ts (loads this)
Does NOT import:
✗ Admin.tsx (don't load)
✗ Dashboard.tsx (don't load)
```

### 3. Layer-Based Loading
**Load context by architectural layer**

```markdown
Frontend Agent needs:
✓ Component layer
✓ Hook layer  
✓ Type layer
✗ API layer (just signatures)
✗ Database layer (none)

Backend Agent needs:
✓ API layer
✓ Business logic layer
✓ Database layer
✗ Component layer (none)
```

### 4. Task-Scoped Context
**Load only files mentioned in task**

```markdown
Task says: "Modify src/components/Auth/Login.tsx"
Load:
✓ Login.tsx (full)
✓ Auth.tsx if imported (partial)
✓ types/auth.ts (signatures)
Don't load:
✗ Other components
✗ Other pages
✗ Unrelated types
```

---

## Agent Communication Protocol

### Handoff Format

**From Orchestrator to Specialist:**
```markdown
AGENT: [Frontend Implementation]
TASK: TASK-042
CONTEXT: Minimal - load task details
ACTION: Implement avatar upload per approved plan
FILES: src/components/profile/AvatarUpload.tsx (new)
CONSTRAINTS: <450 lines, Shadcn UI only
COMPLETION: Update CONTEXT.md, mark subtasks
```

**From Planning to Implementation:**
```markdown
PLAN APPROVED: TASK-042
APPROACH: Use Supabase Storage + client upload
CHANGES:
- New component: AvatarUpload.tsx
- Update: UserProfile.tsx (add upload UI)
- New util: uploadAvatar.ts
RISKS: File size validation critical
PROCEED: Implementation Agent can begin
```

**From Implementation to Testing:**
```markdown
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE: TASK-042
FILES CHANGED:
- src/components/profile/AvatarUpload.tsx (new, 287 lines)
- src/components/profile/UserProfile.tsx (modified)
- src/lib/storage/uploadAvatar.ts (new, 156 lines)
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: See TASK-042
TEST FOCUS: File validation, error states, mobile
```

---

## Continuous Improvement

### Monitoring Agent Performance

**Track these metrics:**
- Token usage per agent type
- Context relevance (was everything loaded necessary?)
- Handoff clarity (did next agent have what they needed?)
- Task completion success rate
- Time to completion

### Optimization Opportunities

**If agent consistently over-budget:**
1. Review what context is loaded
2. Identify unnecessary files
3. Implement more aggressive pruning
4. Consider splitting agent into sub-specialists

**If agent underperforms:**
1. Check if critical context missing
2. Review handoff communication
3. Verify agent has appropriate specialization
4. Consider expanding context slightly

---

## Quick Reference

### Spawning an Agent

```markdown
SPAWN: [Agent Type]
TASK: [TASK-ID]
CONTEXT BUDGET: [Token limit]
LOAD:
- [Critical file 1]
- [Critical file 2]
- [Guideline doc]
DON'T LOAD:
- [Unnecessary context]
OBJECTIVE: [One sentence]
COMPLETION CRITERIA: [What marks this done]
```

### Agent Self-Check

Before starting work, each agent should verify:
- [ ] Loaded only necessary context
- [ ] Understand task objective
- [ ] Know completion criteria  
- [ ] Aware of constraints (450-line limit, etc.)
- [ ] Know how to hand off to next agent

---

**Remember:** Smart agents load less, achieve more. Quality over quantity in context loading.
